Instructions for Installing the CXL Library

Installer packages are included for the macOS platform and Linux platforms
(CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).  The standard
installation packages place files in /usr/local and require superuser (root)
privileges.  (C include files and the 'libcx.a' static library are installed.)
If you are not installing on a macOS or GNU/Linux platform, want to install the
CXL library in your HOME directory, or want to customize the installation
process, please refer to file CustomInstall.txt for instructions.

For a standard installation of the CXL library, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this Install.txt file:

	$ cd CXL-master

 2. If you are installing on a Linux platform, go to the next step; otherwise,
    go to step 5.

 3. The Linux installer is cxl-1.2.0.sh, which includes 64-bit binaries built
    on a CentOS vers. 6 machine.  To run the installer, type the following
    commands:

	$ su root
	# ./cxl-1.2.0.sh
	# exit

 4. Go to step 6.

 5. The macOS installer is cxl-1.2.0.pkg, which includes 64-bit binaries
    built for macOS vers. 10.12 (Sierra) and later.  Open the installer package
    with the following command:

	$ open cxl-1.2.0.pkg

    and run the installer.

 6. The installers place the CXL library in /usr/local/lib as libcx.a.

Note that the -lcx switch or path to the CXL library (/usr/local/lib/libcx.a)
must be provided to the linker when you link your programs.
