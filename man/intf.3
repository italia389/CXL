.SH NAME
\fBintf\fR, \fBuintf\fR - format an integer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include "cxl/lib.h"\fR
.HP 2
\fBchar *intf(long \fIi\fB);\fR
.HP 2
\fBchar *uintf(ulong \fIi\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBintf\fR() and \fBuintf\fR() functions convert respectively, signed and unsigned long integer \fIi\fR to
a string with a leading sign if negative, and commas inserted in every thousands\(aq place so that large numbers
are more readable.  This is useful for reporting.  For example, multiple integers can be processed with either
or both functions and output with a printf(3) specification such as "%24s" to produce a columnar report with
all of the numbers right justified.
.PP
Note that the string that is created by \fBintf\fR() and \fBuintf\fR() is allocated in static storage and
shared, hence it will be overwritten each time either of the functions is called.
.SH RETURN VALUES
The \fBintf\fR() and \fBuintf\fR() functions return a pointer to the formatted string.
.SH SEE ALSO
cxl(3), sprintf(3)
